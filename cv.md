## About me:

I am 30 years old, I worked in different fields, but interest in them quickly faded away, since my school days I was interested in new technologies, their application in practice, I did various projects on arduino, I assembled a 3D printer and a cnc router. Recently I decided to change something in my life and in my free time I started learning programming web programming.

## Skills:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (fundamentals)
- Git
- Figma, Avocode, Photoshop

## Code Example:

**CodeWars:**
In your class, you have started lessons about geometric progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will print first n elements of the sequence with the given constant r and first element a.

Result should be separated by comma and space.

```
let geometricSequenceElements = (a, r, n) => {
  let arr = [];
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++){
  arr.push(a*r**i);
  }
  return arr.join(', ');
}
```
